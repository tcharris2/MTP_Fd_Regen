# Purpose:

This study aims at investigating the individual and interactive effects
of climatic distance from provenance of origin and harvesting method on
the the survival and performance of interior Douglas-fir seedlings.

# Keywords:

Forestry, Silviculture, Ecology, Interior Douglas-fir, Climatic
Distance, Assisted Migration, Climate Change

# Taxonomic Information:

Interior Douglas-fir - Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca (Mayr) Franco
Taxonomic Serial No.: 183428

# Variable Information:

Climatic variables are retried from Climate NA v7.40. Using historical
climate data: Normal_1981_2010.nrm.

Locations are distributed across interior British Columbia (BC) within
the span of interior Douglas-fir’s range. Locations were harvested
between 2017/20, planted between 2018/20, and surveyed between 2020/21.
